- Tag Colors:
  - Rainbow color scheme (distinct color for each tag)

### 2. Hi-Fi Prototype Updates
- Rearranged/added some buttons and functionality
  - Added task/event dropdown
    - Task/events can be selected and appear directly on the log, as opposed to the heading in the log we had originally
  - Clock button
    - A dropdown appears which lets the user select start and end time
  - "Add tag" button
    - User can select a tag (predetermined color) for each task or event

### 3. Address underlying issues with current design
  - Decided that only one tag can be selected per task/event for simplicity and implementation purposes (See Tag Only ADR)
