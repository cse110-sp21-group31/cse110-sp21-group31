## Problem (Statement of Purpose)

- Target struggling college students who need to organize their life
- There is not a quick and easy way to organize your life digitally?
- Help with the uncertainty brought by the pandemic and online education
    - Online education can require more organization and planning
- No application that combines a daily and long-term task list with features like trackers and journaling
    - Utilize photos, videos, and recordings

## Our Solution

- Index / Home Page
- Daily Log
    - Tasks / Events / Notes
- Weekly View
    - Includes lectures and assignments (recurring option available)
    - Synchronized with Daily Log
- Calendar View
    - Keeps track of all events & tasks from Daily Log
- Filtering System
    - By priority, tags (emojis), colors, finished tasks, etc.
    - For Weekly and Calendar View
- Digital media
    - Images, Audio, Video, Embedded Links
    - Add to any task, note or event

## Flowchart

FLOWCHART GOES HERE - TBD

## Scope

- Time for the project: 4 Weeks
- We are limiting to solving the problem identified for college students (at UCSD) only
- We will prioritizing finishing daily logs, calendar view, and the ability to insert audio/images first
- Any extra features will be optional to add if time permits, but they will not be a priority

## Risks/Rabbit Holes

- Having too many features --- unnecessary complication of the user interface
- Avoid creating too many different logs or interface views
- Bugs to Avoid
    - Empty tasks
    - Editing and Deleting tasks and notes
    - Synchronization between different views (logs, index, etc.)

## No-Gos

- Future Log
    - This is already covered by the calendar
